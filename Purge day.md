# Purge Day
Every 6 days, a Purge Day will occur.\
During a Purge Day, all rules that specify to be lifted during purge day will be lifted on this day and any actions that take place on that day that violate said rules will not ever be punishable. (This is to prevent prosecution after Purge Day)\
Each Purge Day, the border will shrink by 7k blocks.

### Nuances
Only Ayaan can announce purge day dates an change them, however this can be voted on.\
If you are outside of the border when it shrinks, you will die and your spawn will be set at world spawn.
