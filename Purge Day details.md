# Purge Day
Every once in a while, a Purge Day will occur.
During Purge Day, all general rules are lifted and any actions that take place on that day that violate said rules will not ever be punishable. (This is to prevent prosecution after Purge Day)

### Nuances
Only Ayaan can announce purge day dates an change them, however this can be voted on.
