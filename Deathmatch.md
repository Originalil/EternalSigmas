#Info
Deathmatch is the 5th Purge Day of the season. It concludes the season with an FFA PvP battle with a small world border. Dying eliminates you from the server, and the last people standing earn rewards according to that of the season. ***(see seasonlog.md)*** It starts when there are 7 players on the server, after which a 5 minute period is given for the rest of players to join. After this, the server is locked, and no new players can join. After that, there will be a battle to the death.
