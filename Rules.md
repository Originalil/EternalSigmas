# Protected Rules
> [!IMPORTANT]
> These rules are **always** active.
> Not understanding rules is **_NOT_** an excuse, you are expected to either ask for clarification or google definitions of words.
> If clarification is asked for but not given, this can be used as evidence to justify your behavior.
1. No Griefing bases | 7d ban | Do not destroy or modify others' structures without permission.
2. No Hacking or Cheats | PERM Ban | No hacked clients, X-ray, auto-clickers, or anything that gives an unfair advantage.
3. Seed cracking | PERM ban | Do not seed crack for whatever reason, the server is mostly seed proofed, meaning you can't use chunk base to find structures.
4. No Exploits or Duping | 2d ban | Do not use glitches to duplicate items or bypass game mechanics.
> [!TIP]
> Exceptions are limited to string (and any craftable item from purely string), TNT, and kelp.
5. No False Reports | 1d ban | Do not report players unless there is evidence to support that they did something violating the rules.
6. No Lag Machines | 1d ban | Any deliberate attempt to crash or slow down the server will result in a ban.
> [!CAUTION]
> Excessive use of benign machines that create lag will be considered a deliberate attempt to cause it.
