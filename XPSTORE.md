# Features
You can just open the Book of Experience and store your levels in it by clicking on the text.

The XP is stored in the item and is neither lost nor reduced when dying.

You can put the item in any container. If you, for example, put it into an Ender Chest, it will be easily accessible to you.

The Book of Experience also allows XP to be used for trading, by dropping one, that has experience in it, to another player.
